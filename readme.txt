BryBoschan Function

Overview
The `BryBoschan` function is a MATLAB script designed for economic data analysis, specifically to identify and compare economic cycles between two data sets. This function calculates the turning point matching rate and provides a comprehensive analysis of turning points (both peaks and troughs) in economic indicators.

Features
- Turning Point Identification: Identifies potential peaks and troughs in economic data series using smoothing and local maximum/minimum checks.
- Data Smoothing: Employs moving averages to smooth the data, which helps in more accurate detection of turning points.
- Turning Point Filtering: Filters and adjusts detected turning points to ensure they meet specific economic cycle characteristics such as minimum durations between peaks and troughs.
- Turning Point Adjustment: Adjusts the detected turning points from the smoothed data back to the original data series to ensure accuracy.
- Turning Point Matching: Compares turning points between a benchmark indicator and a candidate indicator to find matches, mismatches, and excess points. This includes the ability to adjust for lead and lag times.
- Visualization: Provides visual plots to illustrate the potential, filtered, and adjusted turning points on both smoothed and original sequences.
